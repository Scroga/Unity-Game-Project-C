 - There doesn't appear to be anything hereâ€¦

## [kosaak](https://kosaak.itch.io/)
 - Run the game, don't understand what to do. Then realize that i should probably build turels.
 - Woow, there are 3d animations, cool.
 - Play, the game, it is fun, but it wish there was some "juiciness".
 - Then try to let enemies to reach the red cube.
 - Nothing happens (at least i didnt notice anything).

## [StarF0rc3](https://starf0rc3.itch.io/)
 - It is probably the demo of [that game](https://kosaak.itch.io/) (sorry if it's not).
 - I tried to check whether the game will react on the keyboard or mouse inputs, but seems like there is no gameplay.  
 - Maybe the game is not finished yet.

## [Viktor Knobloch](https://viktor-knobloch.itch.io/)
 - Run the first level.
 - Cool, cute visuals. 
 - It seems like i have to touch the finish flag.
 - I cant reach the flag, the player cant jump that high.
 - Then realize that im stupid and i didnt play the tutorial :).
 - Now it makes sense, the player can change its color.
 - I find this mechanic really interesting, because it is simple, but at the same time it will have huge number of possible extensions.
 - I love it, cool game.

## [Martina Kerhartova](https://martina-kerhartova.itch.io/)
 - Start the game.
 - Cool, it has AI system.
 - Run the game with to AI players.
 - Watch them playing. 
 - Play it myself.
 - The game is fun, i didnt see any technical problems.
 - The one problem i see is that sometimes i didnt understand the name of the card that is on the board.
