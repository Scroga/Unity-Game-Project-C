# the GLOO Gun
You are factory worker. The robot system got crazy. You need to leave the factory and survive.

## Game design
- suber basic movement (jump, crouch?)
- Gloo gun
- if the bullet touches an object with collider, it will stop and get soild (now you are able to step on it).
- Bullets are new object on the level
- limit the bullet count on the level (make them dissapear after a while)

- no enemies, but puzzles
- vehicle robots (forklifts?)
- shot in the wheels stops robots for a while

## Level design
- Open levels

## Puzzles
- platforms
- make bridge
- create better path with limited bullets 

## Art
- minimalistic environment
- own 3D models
- no character 3D model (first person)
- no mash or skelet animations (only transform animations)
